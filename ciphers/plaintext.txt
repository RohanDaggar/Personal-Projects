life had been relatively dull since returning from my work with harry in the middle east. the british library was delighted to get its hands on the roman diary and the collector seemed to have forgotten about me, maybe because harry’s team made it too dangerous to hang around. i was happy to settle back in to my work at the library and was involved in a project to track down and catalogue missing documents from the late nineteenth century. they detailed foreign policy, which sounds dull, but with victoria taking an active interest there were a lot of letters between downing street and the palace and i was enjoying spying on famous characters from history. i really felt like i was getting some insight into how they thought and how the modern world came into being in that tumultuous period.
